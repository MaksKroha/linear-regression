# Linear Regression Project

## Description
This project implements a linear regression model to predict continuous outcomes based on input features. It serves as a simple, reusable template for machine learning tasks, focusing on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview
The Linear Regression Project is designed to demonstrate a straightforward implementation of linear regression using Python. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, making it suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex machine learning projects. The project is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/MaksKroha/linear-regression](https://github.com/MaksKroha/linear-regression).

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling features)
- Linear regression model implementation using scikit-learn
- Model evaluation with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score
- Visualization of results (scatter plots, regression line)
- Modular code structure for easy extension

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaksKroha/linear-regression.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd linear-regression
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the main script to train and evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
3. View the output, including model performance metrics and visualizations, in the console or saved files in the `outputs/` directory.

## Examples
To run the model with a sample dataset:
```bash
python src/main.py --dataset data/sample_data.csv
```
This command processes `sample_data.csv`, trains the model, and outputs predictions along with a plot of the regression line saved in `outputs/`.

Example output:
```
Mean Squared Error: 0.042
R² Score: 0.89
Plot saved to outputs/regression_plot.png
```

## Testing
To run the unit tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
Tests cover data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation functions to ensure reliability.

## To-do / Roadmap
- Add support for multiple feature inputs
- Implement cross-validation for better model evaluation
- Add hyperparameter tuning (e.g., regularization)
- Include more advanced visualizations (e.g., residual plots)
- Support additional regression models (e.g., polynomial regression)
